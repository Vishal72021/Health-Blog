      <h1>Eating and exercise: 5 tips to maximize your workouts</h1>
      <p>
        Knowing when and what to eat can make a difference in your workouts.
        Understand the connection between eating and exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eating and exercise go hand in hand. When and what you eat can be
        important to how you feel when you exercise, whether it's a casual
        workout or training for a competition. Consider these eating and
        exercise tips.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Eat a healthy breakfast</h3>
      <p>
        A healthy breakfast Open pop-up dialog box Breakfast If you exercise in
        the morning, get up early enough to finish breakfast at least one hour
        before your workout. Be well fueled going into a workout. Studies
        suggest that eating or drinking carbohydrates before exercise can
        improve workout performance and may allow you to work out for a longer
        time or at a higher intensity. If you don't eat, you might feel sluggish
        or lightheaded when you exercise. If you plan to exercise within an hour
        after breakfast, eat a light breakfast or drink something such as a
        sports drink. Focus on carbohydrates for maximum energy.
      </p>

      <p>Good breakfast options include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Whole-grain cereals or bread</li>
        <li>Low-fat milk</li>
        <li>Juice</li>
        <li>A banana</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And remember, if you normally have coffee in the mornings, a cup before
        your workout is probably OK. Also know that anytime you try a food or
        drink for the first time before a workout, you risk an upset stomach.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Watch the portion size</h3>
      <p>
        Be careful not to overdo it when it comes to how much you eat before
        exercise.
      </p>
      <p>The general guidelines suggest:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large meals. Eat these at least 3 to 4 hours before exercising.</li>
        <li>
          Small meals or snacks. Eat these about 1 to 3 hours before exercising.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eating too much before you exercise can leave you feeling sluggish.
        Eating too little might not give you the energy you need to keep feeling
        strong throughout your workout.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Snack well</h3>
      <p>
        Most people can eat small snacks right before and during exercise. The
        key is how you feel. Do what works best for you. Snacks eaten soon
        before exercise probably won't give you added energy if your workout
        lasts less than 60 minutes, but they may prevent distracting hunger
        pangs. If your workout is longer than 60 minutes, you may benefit by
        including a carbohydrate-rich food or beverage during the workout.
      </p>
      <p>Good snack options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An energy bar</li>
        <li>A banana, an apple or other fresh fruit</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>A fruit smoothie</li>
        <li>A whole-grain bagel or crackers</li>
        <li>A low-fat granola bar</li>
        <li>A peanut butter sandwich</li>
        <li>Sports drink or diluted juice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A healthy snack is especially important if you plan a workout several
        hours after a meal.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Eat after you exercise</h3>
      <p>
        To help your muscles recover and to replace their glycogen stores, eat a
        meal that contains both carbohydrates and protein within two hours of
        your exercise session if possible. Consider a snack if your meal is more
        than two hours away.
      </p>
      <p>Good post-workout food choices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yogurt and fruit</li>
        <li>Peanut butter sandwich</li>
        <li>Low-fat chocolate milk and pretzels</li>
        <li>Post-workout recovery smoothie</li>
        <li>Turkey on whole-grain bread with vegetables</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5. Drink up</h3>
      <p>
        Don't forget to drink fluids. You need adequate fluids before, during
        and after exercise to help prevent dehydration.
      </p>
      <p>
        To stay well hydrated for exercise, the American College of Sports
        Medicine recommends that you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Drink roughly 2 to 3 cups (473 to 710 milliliters) of water during the
          2 to 3 hours before your workout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drink about 1/2 to 1 cup (118 to 237 milliliters) of water every 15 to
          20 minutes during your workout. Adjust amounts related to your body
          size and the weather.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drink roughly 2 to 3 cups (473 to 710 milliliters) of water after your
          workout for every pound (0.5 kilogram) of weight you lose during the
          workout.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Water is generally the best way to replace lost fluids. But if you're
        exercising for more than 60 minutes, use a sports drink. Sports drinks
        can help maintain your body's electrolyte balance and give you a bit
        more energy because they contain carbohydrates.
