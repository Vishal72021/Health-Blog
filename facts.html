          <h2>Mind blowing facts proven by health science</h2>
          <p>
            There are regular studies on health and fitness which in turn have
            proven some astonishing facts. Some of these information have been
            around for years but others are a bit shocking. Here are some of
            those shocking health facts...
          </p>

          <h3>Drinking Coffee Can Prevent Depression</h3>
          <p>
            We hear a lot about the negative effects of caffeine on our health,
            but it turns out that caffeine has its good points too. Research
            from the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who drank
            a minimum of four cups of coffee per day could lower their risk of
            depression by 20 per cent. Earlier research also found that females
            who drank two or more cups per day were less likely to commit
            suicide.

          <h3>Chewing Gum Makes You More Alert</h3>
          <p>
            If you're suffering from a mid-afternoon slump or can’t seem to
            concentrate in the morning, then try chewing some gum to make you
            feel awake. Coventry University researchers found that chewing mint
            flavoured gum dramatically reduced feelings of tiredness. Another
            study on the subject found that chewing gum can improve overall test
            scores and memory by 35 per cent, relieve stress and reduce anxiety
            levels.

          <h3>
            Sitting At A Desk Can Increase Death Risk By Almost 50 Per Cent
          </h3>
          <p>
            Office workers beware, as research from the University of Sydney
            found that office workers who sit for longer than 10 hours a day at
            their desk had a 48 per cent increase in risk of death, in
            comparison to people who sat for less than four hours a day. To
            counteract this health risk, try to introduce five minutes of
            activity every hour and make sure you take regular breaks away from
            your workstation. Simple changes like taking the stairs instead of
            the lift will also make a positive difference to your health.

          <h3>ATM Machines And Public Toilets Are Equally Dirty</h3>
          <p>
            Withdrawing money from a cash machine is something may of us do
            regularly, but how many of us give our hands a wash after using
            them? Cleanliness tests carried out in Britain found that ATM
            machines were as dirty as the toilets. Specialists investigated
            swabs taken from the cash machine keyboards and from public toilets
            nearby and found both samples had the same bacteria known to lead to
            sickness.

          <h3>If You’re An Optimist, It Could Help You Live Longer</h3>
          <p>
            According to a study from Duke University Medical Center, heart
            patients who were more optimistic about their treatment, actually
            lived longer than those who were more pessimistic in their mindsets.
            Also, according to findings of a study published in the European
            Heart Journal, people who are optimistic have less chance of
            suffering from heart disease.

          <h3>Smell An Apple To Prevent Claustrophobia</h3>
          <p>
            An apple a day can do more than just keep the doctor away, it can
            also help with claustrophobia. Apparently smelling a green apple
            will relieve the stress associated with confined spaces, according
            to research from the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research
            Foundation. Sniffing a green apple can also prevent headaches and
            migraines and some homeowners even use the scent to make their
            houses seem bigger to potential buyers.

          <h3>If You’re Tired… Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            After a long day at work, going to the gym is probably the last
            thing on your list of priorities but research has found that
            exercising actually gives you more energy. A study published in
            Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that levels of
            fatigue and depression improved after a 30-minute session of
            moderate intensity exercise. This is because exercise improves your
            cardiovascular health which means that more blood and oxygen flow
            around the body, therefore giving you more energy.

          <h3>Sit-Ups Won’t Give You A Flat Stomach</h3>
          <p>
            Many people fall into the trap of thinking that they can achieve a
            flat stomach by doing crunches. But the truth is, endless amounts of
            crunches won’t give you the stomach of your dreams - as the exercise
            only works your abs, not your core muscles. One study published in
            the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found carrying out
            six weeks of abdominal exercises alone was not enough to reduce
            abdominal fat.

          <h3>Handwriting Things Can Help Your Memory</h3>
          <p>
            Research from Indiana University found that in order to remember
            something, you should handwrite notes, rather than type them.
            Writing is thought to boost your memory as note taking by hand
            requires different cognitive processes than typing. For example, if
            in a lecture you are writing notes, you have to listen carefully to
            what the speaker has said as it is impossible to write down every
            word. Therefore through this process, you are listening, digesting
            and summarising the information more effectively than someone who is
            just typing words into a laptop.
          </p>

          <h3>To Cool Down, Drink Something Hot</h3>
          <p>
            It might sound counterproductive, but if you want to cool down, then
            drink something hot. According to a study from the University of
            Ottawa’s school of Human Kinetics, as the drink is hotter than your
            body temperature, it triggers a sweat response in the body that more
            than compensates for the increase. So although it might initially
            make you feel hotter, a hot drink will cause you to sweat more and
            therefore the body effectively cools itself quicker.
