                >A --> When you get sick, part or all of your body is not
                working as it should. The cause of sickness can come from inside
                your body or from the outside world. Diseases that start on the
                inside are usually inherited in the genes that you receive from
                your parents, which make up the master plan that determines how
                your body will grow and run. Abnormal development or functioning
                of different body systems is the cause of many chronic diseases.
                Things in the outside world can cause sickness too. Poisons in
                the environment can cause illnesses in people. Not eating the
                right foods, with their important nutrients, can also cause
                diseases. But the most common cause of sickness from the outside
                world is infectious agents. These agents are usually microscopic
                organisms (living things so small that they can only be seen
                with the help of microscopes) such as bacteria and viruses,
                commonly referred to as germs. Bacteria and viruses and other
                microscopic organisms live in the air, water, and soil that make
                up our world. They are on the things and people we touch and in
                the food we eat. Many of them are beneficial: bacteria are
                needed to make cheese, some bacteria help vegetables grow, and
                some bacteria clean the environment and enrich the soil by
                feeding on dead plants and animals. But there are other
                microscopic organisms that invade the bodies of plants and
                animals—and people—and cause diseases.</em

                >Your skin is a wonderful protective barrier that prevents many
                of the disease-causing germs that you run into each day from
                entering your body. Only when you have an opening in your
                skin—like a cut or a scrape—are germs likely to enter there.
                Most germs enter through your mouth and nose, making their way
                farther into your body through your respiratory or digestive
                tracts. But even then, certain chemicals in body tissues and
                fluids keep many harmful germs from causing problems. When an
                infection does begin—with the germs multiplying inside your
                body—your immune systemleaps into action to get rid of the
                foreign organisms. Your white blood cells produce special
                substances called antibodies that attack and destroy the
                invaders, helping you to recover.</em

                and lymphoid organs. Anatomy, physiology, science, biology,
                lymph nodes, nervous system, appendix, thoracic duct, lymphatic
                duct, thymus gland, tonsil, spleen, bone marrow. The immune
                system protects the human body against germs, which are
                microorganisms that cause sickness and disease. There are four
                major types of germs— harmful bacteria (pathogens), viruses,
                fungi, and protozoa. This defense system begins with the skin,
                which stops germs from getting into your blood or tissues. If
                germs get into your body, for example through your nose or
                mouth, white blood cells called phagocytes and lymphocytes
                attack them. Phagocytes scout out and destroy invaders, and
                long-living lymphocytes remember the invaders and release
                chemicals called antibodies to make the body resistant, or
                immune, to them. White blood cells live in the bloodstream,
                lymphatic system, and spleen. The lymphatic system (or lymph
                system, for short) is a far-reaching network that extends
                throughout your entire body. A clear liquid called lymph runs
                throughout the system, washing the body’s cells with nutrients
                and water and detecting and removing pathogens. Lymph is
                filtered through the lymph nodes and then passes into the body's
                bloodstream.</em

                ability to feed themselves and to reproduce. They are found
                everywhere, including the air, water, and soil. They divide and
                multiply very quickly, which means that one cell can become 1
                million cells in just a few hours. Viruses are microorganisms
                that are smaller than bacteria, but they cannot grow or
                reproduce without the help of a separate living cell. Once a
                virus gets inside your body, it attaches itself to a healthy
                cell and uses the cell’s nucleus to reproduce itself.</em

                invading our homes, pets, and family, and sometimes they make us
                sick. Besides your bathroom toilet and the kitchen sink,
                everyday items such as shopping carts, restaurant menus, mobile
                phones, and shower curtains contain germs. These items contain
                bacteria, mold, and rhinoviruses (instigators of the common
                cold) that can lead to sickness. In fact, cold and flu viruses
                can survive for 18 hours on hard surfaces. Common household
                items can be swabbed with a disinfectant wipe easily before use
                in order to prevent germs from spreading. Washing your hands
                with soap and water, using hand sanitizer, and avoiding touching
                your face with your hands after using these items also helps
                keep germs away from you. To eliminate dust mites—those little
                critters that live in your bed sheets and feed on dead skin
                cells—don’t make your bed for a while. Studies have found that
                dust mites need humidity levels above 50 percent to survive and
                cannot live in the arid conditions of an unmade bed.</em

                >A --> An allergic reaction is a reaction to a substance that is
                typically harmless to most other people. Allergies happen when a
                person’s immune system overreacts to a substance that the person
                has breathed in, touched, or eaten. Allergens—the antigens that
                bring on an allergic reaction—may be foods, medications, plants
                or animals, chemicals, dust, or molds. Some common allergic
                reactions are hay fever, allergic conjunctivitis (an eye
                reaction), asthma, pet-dander allergies, and skin reactions,
                such as hives. A common cause for allergies are dust mites, a
                large part of household dust. If they are breathed in by an
                allergic person, the body parts of the dead mites can trigger
                asthma, a lung condition that causes a person to have difficulty
                breathing. Cat and dog dander, or skin flakes, can cause an
                allergic reaction, such as sneezing, wheezing, and runny eyes
                and nose. Common food allergy triggers are the proteins in cow’s
                milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree
                nuts.</em

                penicillin, which is made from mold. Penicillin kills bacteria

                found that mold had accidentally contaminated one of his
                experiments. The mold created a bacteria-free circle around
                itself, and Fleming deduced that the mold was an antibacterial
                agent that could kill many harmful bacteria. He named the active
                agent penicillin. By the middle of the 20th century, Fleming’s

                Ebola vaccine in Conakry, Guinea, March 7, 2015. The World
                Health Organization will start large-scale testing of an
                experimental Ebola vaccine. Edward Jenner, an army surgeon and
                country doctor from Gloucestershire, England, tried his first
                experimental vaccination in 1796. At the time, smallpox was a
                fatal disease that mostly affected infants and young children.
                Jenner recognized that dairymaids infected with cowpox virus (a
                minor virus that affected cows) were immune to smallpox. He used
                material from the arm of Sarah Nells, a dairymaid who had
                contracted cowpox, to infect James Phipps, an eight-year-old
                boy. He then exposed Phipps to smallpox, which Phipps did not
                contract. It worked because cowpox and smallpox have common
                antigens (proteins), which activated the young boy’s immune
                system. After repeating the experiment on other children,
                including his own son, Jenner concluded that vaccination
                provided immunity to smallpox without the risk of the person
                contracting the disease. Jenner used the word vaccination for
                his treatment, which comes from the Latin word vacca, meaning
                “cow.” Jenner’s findings were published two years later, in
                1798, and today vaccines are used around the world to produce
                immunity to disease.</em

                the symptoms. For centuries, people around the world have used
                chicken soup to treat the common cold. Chicken soup can help
                people feel better, but scientists have learned that chicken fat
                may help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, the
                chicken broth acts as an anti-inflammatory by slowing down the
                movement of neutrophils (immune system cells that play a role in
                the body’s inflammatory response). Second, it temporarily speeds
                up the movement of mucus through the nose. This movement helps
                relieve congestion and limits the amount of time viruses are in
                contact with the nose’s lining.</em

                control body fat, helps prevent certain illnesses, and
                contributes to a good outlook on life. Regular exercise helps
                promote digestion and a good night’s sleep. When children
                exercise as part of their busy lives, they are better equipped
                to manage the physical and emotional challenges of a busy day.
                Many governments and other organizations recommend at least 150
                minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every week.</em

                slows down the body’s central nervous system. After a person has
                had a few drinks, it immediately affects the way they think or
                act. Alcohol can make a person feel sleepy, less coordinated,
                and slow to react. And it can cause your brain to feel foggy as
                well as make you think and see differently. After years of
                drinking, alcohol use can cause stomach and intestinal problems,
                liver damage, nerve and muscle damage, heart problems, and brain
                damage. Alcohol can cause everything from blackouts to permanent
                loss of brain function and memory. Researchers have also linked
                long-term drinking to cancer of the throat, mouth, liver,
                esophagus, and larynx. Drinking alcohol can also lead to
                emotional and psychological problems such as sadness and
                depression. If a pregnant woman drinks too much alcohol, it can

                many harmful chemicals, including tar and the poisonous gas
                carbon monoxide. These chemicals present health risks that range
                from bronchitis to cancer. Doctors believe that cigarette
                smoking is the cause of 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer.
                Heart disease, heart attack, and stroke are far more common in
                smokers. One of the effects of nicotine is constricting the
                blood vessels, which causes high blood pressure. Another effect
                is that smoking raises your heart rate, which adds extra stress
                on your heart. Smoking also affects every part of the body’s
                circulatory system. Your blood becomes thicker and stickier,
                making it harder for your heart to work effectively. The lining
                of the blood vessels is damaged, allowing fat deposits to stick,
                which most likely causes arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the
                arteries. Smoking also stains teeth, fingernails, and lung
                tissue, and it causes bad breath.</em
